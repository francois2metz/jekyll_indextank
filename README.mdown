## Jekyll + indextank = Static websites with powerful full-text search

### How to use:
* Place jekyll_indextank.rb inside the _plugins folder in the root of your jekyll site.
* Add 'indextank_index', 'indextank_api_url' and optionally 'indextank_excludes' settings to your _config.yml

All pages' main content will be indexed at indextank, now all you have to do is hook up some Javascript and ajax
to a form to query the [indextank api](http://indextank.com/documentation/api#searching).  
Note that, while at the time of writing, the indextank api docs do not show that the search api supports jsonp, it does.
Just add `&callback=mycallback` to the api call.

### How it works
Everytime you generate your Jekyll site, all pages will be indexed at IndexTank. Now when you query the IndexTank search api,
something like this will be returned:

	{"matches": 1, "facets": {}, "search_time": "0.002", "results": [{"docid": "/blog/2009/01/04/colored-uiprogressview.html"}]}

The "docid" field contains the absolute url (minus domain name) to the matched resource.

### JavaScript usage example

	$.getJSON("http://<your_api_key>.api.indextank.com/v1/indexes/<your_index>/search?q=<a query>&callback=?", function(json) {
    	alert(json.results); //you might want to approve usability a bit ;-)
	});

  See examples/example.html for a basic example, showing results in a div.
